						</li>
						<li>
							Several fixes in the <strong class="blue">Board detection algorithm</strong> and the path drawing.
							<p>

							</p>
							<p class="red">
								There is a possibility of regression (ie : the path will not be aligned anymore) with all devices. Please notify me ASAP if you notice a problem !
							</p>
						</li>
						<li> 
							The <strong class="blue">TensorFlow™</strong> native Android library was added to the app (~20 Mo). Sorry for the huge size.
							<p>
                                With this library, I will be able to use <strong class="blue">machine learning</strong> to detect the orbs color. It should be more consistent, and will reduce the number of bad detections.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            	The app now sends a small orb image (48x48) when it doesn't recognize it. You can disable this feature if you want (in the option page), but I advise you not to.

						</li>
						<li> 
							New way for selecting orb color in the <strong class="blue">manual board setting</strong> mode 
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Version 1.3.4</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Small progress on <strong class="blue">mortal poison</strong> orb support <i>(waiting on more data to refine the orb detection)</i>
						</li>
						<li> 
							Some small cyan dots are added on the corners on the board. 
							<p>
								It serves no other purpose than to help me debug those who have a calibration problem. Please tell me if these dots bother you !
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Version 1.3.3</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong class="blue">Mortal poison</strong> orb partial support <i>(waiting on more data to refine the orb detection)</i>
							<p>
								This may have caused some regressions in the app (I had to add a new type of orb and it's not something that easy).
								<strong>Don't hesitate to report any regression.</strong>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li> 
							<strong class="blue">Gadius</strong> & <strong class="blue">Typhon</strong> leader skills added
						</li>
						<li> 
							Graphical bug (overlay's `Quit` button not aligned) fixed
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Version 1.3.2</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> 
							<strong class="blue">Path drawing size</strong> option added
							<p>
								 You can now choose the overlay path size
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Version 1.3.1</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> 
							<strong class="blue">Manual board setting</strong> mode fixed (it was not working...)
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Version 1.3</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> 
							<strong class="blue">Google Drive</strong> support <i>(experimental)</i>
							<p>
								 You can now save and load your custom profiles with Google Drive. Useful if you want to change your phone without losing all your custom profiles !
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Version 1.2</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> 
							<strong class="blue">Delete screenshots</strong> option added
							<p>
								Choose whether or not you want the app to remove the screenshots you take (only in screenshot mode).
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong class="blue">Error logs</strong> option added
							<p>
								You can now help me debug the app. Just check this option, and the crash reports will be automatically sent (when the app starts, after a crash).
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							The app will not crash anymore when facing a black board (after a blind)
							<p>
								 Instead you will have a board full of "Jammers". Using the <strong class="blue">manual board setting</strong> mode is highly recommended in these situations.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> 
							<strong class="blue">Manual board setting</strong> mode (available under the option menu in the overlay)
							<p>
								You can now set manually the board before lauching the path finding algorithm. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Just click on the orbs to set them to the desired color.
							</p>
							<p>
								A button is available to toggle the <i>consistence</i> of the board : it means that you can toggle the transparency and the ability to click through (useful to quickly set the manual board when facing an hidden P&amp;D board).
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong class="blue">Changelog</strong>  is available using a webview <i>(experimental)</i>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Awoken Tsukuyomi</strong> preset modified
						</li>
					</ul>
					
				<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
					<ul>
